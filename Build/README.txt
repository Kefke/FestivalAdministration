How to launch Festival Administration:

1) You should start USBWebserver before launching FestivalAdministration.
   USBWebserver can be found in ../USBWebserver/usbwebserver.exe

2) The icons next to Apache and Mysql should be green in order for the 
   program to work properly. If they are not, please shut down other
   webservers or software such as skype, that could use the required ports.

3) Once this is done you can launch FestivalAdministration.exe
